## Selenium with Pytest and Framework Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation provides guidance on using Selenium with Pytest along with a framework for efficient web testing in Python. Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers, and Pytest is a popular testing framework in Python. Combining them with a framework structure enhances maintainability and scalability of test suites. Additionally, allure-pytest is used for generating detailed test reports.

## Installation

1. **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Selenium**: Install Selenium using pip:

    ```
    pip install selenium
    ```

3. **Pytest**: Install Pytest using pip:

    ```
    pip install pytest
    ```

4. **Allure-Pytest**: Install allure-pytest for generating detailed test reports:

    ```
    pip install allure-pytest
    ```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Selenium tests and framework.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies by running:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configuration**: Configure your test environment by modifying configuration files as per your requirements.

4. **Writing Tests**: Write your Selenium tests using Pytest syntax. Ensure tests are organized within the framework structure.

## Framework Structure

The framework follows a modular structure for better organization and scalability. Here's an overview:

- **`tests/`**: This directory contains test files written using Pytest.

- **`pages/`**: Contains Page Object classes representing web pages. Each page object encapsulates the functionality and elements of a particular web page.

- **`utilities/`**: Utility functions and helper classes that aid in test automation.

- **`config/`**: Configuration files for managing test environments and settings.

- **`reports/`**: Directory for storing test reports generated during test execution.

## Writing Tests

1. **Setup and Teardown**: Use fixture functions provided by Pytest for setup and teardown operations before and after tests.

2. **Page Objects**: Utilize Page Object design pattern to represent web pages and interact with elements within them.

3. **Assertions**: Use Pytest's built-in assertion mechanisms to verify expected outcomes.

4. **Parameterization**: Parameterize tests to run with different datasets, enhancing test coverage.

5. **Allure Reporting**: Utilize allure-pytest for generating detailed test reports.

## Running Tests

Execute tests using Pytest command-line interface:

```
pytest --alluredir=./reports
```

Optionally, you can specify specific tests or directories:

```
pytest path/to/test_file.py
```

## Generating Reports

After test execution, reports will be generated in the `reports/` directory. These reports provide detailed information on test results, including passed, failed, and skipped tests. You can view the reports by running:

```
allure serve reports/
```
